    # Max's PhD Webinar

    Welcome to my PhD webinar site, where I'll be hosting a weekly discussion related to my research on the _neuroscience of decision-making_.
    
    These discussions are intended to: 
    
    1. Make my work accessible to the general public, and 
    2. Provide me with an opportunity to workshop sections from my thesis.
    
    
    You can participate in the live version of my talks on **[Sundays at 11:00 EST](https://columbiacuimc.zoom.us/j/94362616057?pwd=UHdkeWxTRllFVjU3WUZ3cTlDbldzZz09)**, or view the materials on this site.
