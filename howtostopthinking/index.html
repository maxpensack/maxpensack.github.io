	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

    <p>Welcome to my webinar site! Here I'll be hosting a weekly discussion related to my research on the <b>neuroscience of decision-making</b>.</p>

    <p>Specifically, I am interested in how the brain transitions from thoughts to actions. Each week I will cover a different aspect of this topic, from anatomy and physiology, to psychology and philosophy, to experimental design and data analysis.</p>

    <p>These discussions are intended share my work with the general public, and to provide an opportunity for me to research and workshop sections my PhD thesis.</p>
