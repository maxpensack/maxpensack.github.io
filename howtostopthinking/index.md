<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
Welcome to my webinar site! Here I'll be hosting a weekly discussion related to my research on the **neuroscience of decision-making**.

Specifically, I am interested in how the brain transitions from thoughts to actions. Each week we will cover a different aspect of this topic, ranging from anatomy and physiology to psychology and philosophy, to experimental design and data analysis.

These discussions are intended share my work with the general public, and to provide an opportunity for me to research and workshop sections my PhD thesis.

You can participate live on **[Sundays at 11:00 am EST](https://columbiacuimc.zoom.us/j/94362616057?pwd=UHdkeWxTRllFVjU3WUZ3cTlDbldzZz09)**, or view the archived materials on this website.
