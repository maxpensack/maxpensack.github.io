title: How to Stop Thinking
---
<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
Welcome to my webinar site! Here I'll be hosting a weekly discussion related to my research on the neuroscience of decision-making. Our guiding question will be:

**How does the brain transition from thought to action?**

Or,

**How do we stop thinking and do something?**

Each week we will cover a different aspect of this question, from psychology and behavior, to anatomy and physiology. We will also cover issues related to the scientific method, and some philosophical puzzles about the nature of thoughts and actions.

These discussions are intended for a general audience, so no expert knowledge is required at the beginning. But we won't shy away from detail, so hold on tight!

You can participate in these sessions live on [Sundays at 11:00 am EST](https://columbiacuimc.zoom.us/j/94362616057?pwd=UHdkeWxTRllFVjU3WUZ3cTlDbldzZz09), or view the archived materials [here](https://www.maxpensack.com/howtostopthinking/calendar/).
