<p>When studying a complex system like the brain, it is often difficult to find a best starting point, since many topics are interrelated. For that reason, these weekly webinars will be organized "corkscrew" style - covering broadly the same topics at increasing levels of detail.</p>

<p>The broad outline will be as follows:
    <ol>
        <li>First Pass:
            <ol>
                <li>Session 1 - Overview of the question. A motivating example. Overview of topic areas.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Second Pass:
            <ol>
                <li>Session 2</li>
                <li>Session 3</li>
                <li>Session 4</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Third Pass:
            <ol>
                <li>asdfasdf</li>
                <li>asdfasdf</li>
                <li>asdfasdf</li>
                <li>asdfasdf</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
